## Key Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Automates the extraction of relevant information from resumes.
- **Job Description Analysis**: Analyzes job descriptions to identify key requirements.
- **Candidate Matching**: Uses AI algorithms to match candidates with job openings based on their qualifications and the job requirements.
- **Results Visualization**: Analysis results are displayed in a user-friendly manner, offering insights into which candidates best fit the job requirements.

## Technology Stack

The project is split into two main components:
- **Frontend**: The user interface, built with React, provides interactive and dynamic web pages to handle user inputs and display data.
- **Backend**: A Node.js/Express application that handles API requests, processes data, and interacts with a MongoDB database. The resume analysis and candidate matching are performed using Gemini's API.

For detailed information on the setup, dependencies, and specific configurations of each component, please refer to the respective README files in the frontend and backend directories.
