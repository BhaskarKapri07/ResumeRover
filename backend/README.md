# Backend Services for Resume Analysis Platform

The backend of the Resume Analysis Platform is comprised of two distinct but interconnected services, each developed with different technologies and designed to handle specific aspects of the application's functionality. This multi-service architecture allows leveraging the unique strengths of each technology stack to enhance the platform's capabilities and performance.

## Services Description

### Node/Express Service

The Node/Express service forms the core of the backend, handling user interactions, data processing, and communications with the MongoDB database. It provides robust API endpoints for user authentication, data submission, and retrieval of analysis results, ensuring secure and efficient operations. This service is optimized for handling web requests and delivering dynamic content to the frontend.

### Python Service

The Python service supplements the main Node/Express backend by providing specialized data processing capabilities, particularly in the areas of web scraping and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Utilizing libraries such as Beautiful Soup for scraping and spaCy for NLP, this service focuses on extracting and analyzing text data from various web sources, enriching the platform's ability to analyze resumes and job descriptions with enhanced precision.

## Functionality

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and user profile management.
- **Data Processing**: Handling and storage of resumes and job descriptions.
- **Resume Analysis**: Detailed analysis of resumes against job descriptions, providing insights into candidate suitability.
- **Web Scraping and NLP**: Extracting additional data from the web to augment analysis capabilities.

## Collaboration Between Services

The Node/Express and Python services communicate via HTTP requests, with data passed between them as needed for specific tasks. For instance, the Python service may receive data extracted from web sources, process it, and then send the results back to the Node/Express service for storage and further use.
